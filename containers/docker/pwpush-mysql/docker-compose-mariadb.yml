    # You can set environment variables here, or in a .env file.  See:
    # https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/
    #
    # Password Pusher provides an example Docker environment file:
    # https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/tree/master/containers/docker/pwpush-docker-env-file
    #
    # See also the Password Pusher Configuration documentation
    # https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/blob/master/Configuration.md
    #
    # Uncomment the following lines to set environment variables and add your own.
    # environment:
    #   PWP__PW__EXPIRE_AFTER_DAYS_DEFAULT: "1"
    #   PWP__PW__EXPIRE_AFTER_VIEWS_MIN: "1"
    #   PWP__PW__RETRIEVAL_STEP_DEFAULT: "true"
    #
    # Uncomment the following lines to mount a volume.
    # volumes:
    #   # Example of a persistent volume for the storage directory (file uploads)
    #   - /path/to/directory:/opt/PasswordPusher/storage:rw
    #
    # Or you could override a single file in the container with a bind mount:
    # volumes:
    #   - type: bind
    #     source: /path/to/my/custom/settings.yml
    #     target: /opt/PasswordPusher/config/settings.yml
    #
    # To customise the application via configuration file, see settings.yml:
    # https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/blob/master/config/settings.yml
    #
    # Then you can use the above bind mount to overlay the file into the container on boot.
